# Factory-IO-Project


**Python Files:**
  -	main.py : runs the Factory IO system correctly-takes a box and brings it to the end of the conveyor without it falling off the edge
  - attack.py: attack that turns off both conveyors
  -	attack_delay.py: attack that turns off both conveyors with delay to mimic the elapsed packet time distribution found in the main.py file
  
**PCAP Data**: Contains the pcap and csv Wireshark data
  -	Attack: contains the simple attack Wireshark capture of the main.py file running and then the attack.py file is run and stopped.
  -	Attack_Delay: contains the Wireshark capture of the main.py file running and then the attack_delay.py file is run and stopped.
  -	Normal Activity: contains the Wireshark of just the main.py file running 


**Intrusion Detection Systems:** 
  -	Offline_IDS.html: the html of my Juypter notebook for my offline Intrusion Detection System
  -	Offline_IDS.ipynb: the Juypter notebook for my offline Intrusion Detection System
  -	Online IDS.py: the online intrusion detection python file

DEMO.mp4: This is a demo video that explains how the offline and online Intrusion Detection Systems work as well as demonstrating that they can detect the presence of an attack
